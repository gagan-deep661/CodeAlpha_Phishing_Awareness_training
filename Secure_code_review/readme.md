# Secure Code Review

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python-based network sniffer created as part of a cybersecurity internship task. The objective of this project was to analyze the sniffer's code for security vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and ensure the reliability of the application.

## Description of the Network Sniffer
The network sniffer captures and analyzes network packets using the Scapy library. It provides insights into network traffic, which can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting network issues.

## Secure Code Review Process
As part of the task, a comprehensive secure code review was conducted. The review focused on identifying potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring that best practices in coding were followed.

### Tools Used
- **Bandit**: A static analysis tool designed to find common security issues in Python code.
- **Pylint**: A code analysis tool that checks for errors and enforces coding standards.
- **Safety**: A tool that checks Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scapy

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
pip3 install scapy
