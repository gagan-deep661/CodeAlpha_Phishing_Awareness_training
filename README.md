# CodeAlpha Internship Projects

During my internship at CodeAlpha, I completed several projects focused on enhancing cybersecurity awareness and developing practical tools using Python. This repository contains the following projects:

## 1. Phishing Awareness Training

This folder contains a presentation designed to educate users about phishing attacks, how to recognize them, and how to avoid falling victim to phishing schemes. This training module can be used by individuals or organizations as part of a security awareness program.

## 2. Network Sniffer

This folder contains a basic network sniffer built in Python using the Scapy library. It captures and analyzes network packets, providing information like source IP, destination IP, and protocols (TCP/UDP).
Features
- Captures and displays real-time network packets.
- Filters packets by protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.).

## 3. Secure Code Review

This folder contains a Python-based network sniffer created as part of a cybersecurity internship task. The objective of this project was to analyze the sniffer's code for security vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and ensure the reliability of the application.
The network sniffer captures and analyzes network packets using the Scapy library. It provides insights into network traffic, which can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting network issues.As part of the task, a comprehensive secure code review was conducted. The review focused on identifying potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring that best practices in coding were followed.
